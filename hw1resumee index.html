<li> Graduate of St John's University</li>
<li> Degree in Enterprise Regulation</li>
<li> Learning HTML and CSS</li>
<li> If eating is a hobby then that's my hobby.</li>
<li> I love politics but I'm not a fan of this election cycle.</li>

<p> Throughout my undergrad years I had the opportunity to work at Planned Parenthood learning about politics and reproductive rights. I've also worked on a few campaigns which solidified my interest in politics. Although my time campaigning has been fun and rewarding, I'm interested in other fields such as Web development.
